You can change the background of all slides by adding the following frontmatter:

```md
---
bg: red
---
```

```md
---
bg: '#ff0000'
---
```

```md
---
bg: rgb(70, 70, 255)
---
```

You can also set the background to transparent for all slides. This is especially useful if you want to use your slides as overlay source for OBS.

```md
---
bg: transparent
---
```
