#### Mermaid Configuration
It's possible to overload the default mermaid configuration to change the behaviour / layout of the rendered mermaid diagrams. To do so, add a mermaid property to yaml as following:

mermaid:
  themeVariables:
    fontSize: 32px
  theme: 'forest'


```md
---
mermaid:
  themeVariables:
    fontSize: 32px
  theme: 'forest'
---
```
